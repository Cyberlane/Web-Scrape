Web-Scrape
==========

I have to scrape data from websites for data collection quite often, and when looking online recently I found that nobody has yet posted up a library to help automate this process a bit. As a result I decided to clean up the code I use and publish it as an open source library for others to use.

When I have a bit more time, I will add some documentation and sample code.
